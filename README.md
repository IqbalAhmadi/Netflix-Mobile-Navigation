# Netflix Navigation ðŸ”¥

The **Netflix Mobile Navigation Application** is a web-based project that aims to replicate the mobile navigation experience of the popular Netflix app. Users can interact with the navigation icon in the top-left corner, triggering a transition effect that mimics the appearance of the Netflix interface. The navigation icon smoothly transitions between three different colors (white, red, and black), and when closed, it smoothly transitions back with a slight delay to closely resemble the Netflix app's behavior. The project is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Font Awesome for icons.
